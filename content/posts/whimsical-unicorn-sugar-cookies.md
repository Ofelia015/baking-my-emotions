## Whimsical Unicorn Sugar Cookies

Greetings, dear readers! It's Ofelia here, and today, I'm bringing a sprinkle of magic and whimsy to your kitchen with a recipe that has taken TikTok by storm: **Unicorn Sugar Cookies**. This trend combines the timeless appeal of sugar cookies with the enchantment of unicorns, creating a treat that's as delightful to look at as it is to eat.

The craze for unicorn-themed everything has been unmissable on social media, and when I stumbled upon these cookies, with their vibrant colors and playful decorations, I knew I had to try making them myself. The result? A batch of cookies that not only taste like a dream but also spark so much joy with their rainbow colors and glittering edible decorations. Whether you're baking for a special occasion or just looking to brighten up your day, these Unicorn Sugar Cookies are a perfect choice.

### Recipe

**Ingredients:**

- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- Food coloring (assorted colors)
- Edible glitter or sprinkles (for decoration)

**Instructions:**

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt.
2. In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, then the vanilla, mixing well after each addition.
3. Gradually add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.
4. Divide the dough into several portions (depending on how many colors you want to use), and color each with a few drops of food coloring. Knead gently until the color is uniform.
5. Wrap each colored dough in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least an hour.
6. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line baking sheets with parchment paper.
7. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface and cut out cookies using a unicorn-shaped cookie cutter.
8. Place cookies on the prepared baking sheets and bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges are just starting to turn golden.
9. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
10. Decorate with edible glitter or sprinkles to bring your unicorns to life.

### Pro Tips

- When coloring the dough, start with a small amount of food coloring and add more as needed to achieve the desired shade.
- If you don't have a unicorn cookie cutter, don't worry! Get creative with any cookie cutter you have, or even make your own unicorn shapes freehand.
- The key to the perfect sugar cookie is not overworking the dough. Mix until just combined for tender, flaky cookies.
- For an extra magical touch, use a small paintbrush to apply edible gold dust to the unicorn horns after baking.

Embracing the joy and creativity of baking has never been more delightful with these Unicorn Sugar Cookies. They're a hit on TikTok for a reason, and I'm sure they'll be a hit in your home too. Enjoy baking, and don't forget to share your magical creations with loved ones. Until next time, keep spreading sweetness and light in every batch!
