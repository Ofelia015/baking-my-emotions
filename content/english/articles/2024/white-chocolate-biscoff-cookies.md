Hey again! This is Ofelia and welcome to another cookie recipe. Remember to go read the About section to find out more about why I made this blog, and get to know me a little bit. This time I’ll be sharing with you a recipe that Chipz’ clients adore: White Chocolate Biscoff Cookies. 

When I started selling cookies, I played around with different twists using my basic brown butter dough. It was a real time-saver and gave me a simpler starting point for my recipes. Having a small business can get a little overwhelming, especially when everything feels complicated. But as I learned more recipes, I realized that simplicity is key. It's better to focus on perfecting a few things rather than trying to do too much.

In this recipe, the brown butter adds a nice crunch to each cookie. Adding biscoff cookie butter boosts the sweetness, so you might want to cut back on the sugar a bit if you prefer them less sweet. But if you're okay with extra sweetness, go for it! Once you try this version of the brown butter recipe, you'll probably start thinking about other ways to mix it up with different ingredients. Hope you enjoy it!


### Recipe

**Ingredients:**

- 1 ½ cups of all-purpose flour
- ½ cup of  unsalted butter (1 stick)
- ¾ cup of brown sugar
- ½ cup of granulated sugar
- 1 egg
- ½ teaspoon of baking soda
- 1 teaspoon of salt
- 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
- ¼ of a cup of biscoff cookie butter (or any cookie butter brand)
- 1 tablespoons of espresso shot
- 90 gr of white chocolate
- 10-11 biscoff cookies

**Instructions:**

1. Place a small saucepan on medium-high heat and melt the butter until it turns golden brown. Let it cool completely in a heat-resistant container or cup at room temperature.
2. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the brown sugar and white sugar until well incorporated.
3. Once the butter has cooled down, pour it into the mixing bowl with the sugar, leaving a small amount in the saucepan to avoid excess liquidity. Whisk until fully combined.
4. Add the egg, vanilla extract, cookie butter, and espresso shot (approximately 2 tablespoons or slightly less). Mix for about a minute and a half until smooth.
5. Sift the flour, baking soda, and salt into the mixture. Whisk a little before adding it all to the cookie mixture. Fold the mixture using a spatula, making circular motions and pressing firmly to ensure complete incorporation. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl to incorporate all ingredients evenly. Adjust the flour if the dough is too liquidy, ensuring it becomes firm without making it cake-like.
6. Cut the chocolate into medium chunks, and add them to the cookie dough, folding until fully incorporated.
7. Chill the dough for at least an hour.
8. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) for 15 minutes.
9. Form 10-11 balls from the dough, using an ice cream scoop for best results.
10. Grease a baking tray with butter and place the dough balls about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, avoiding overbaking to prevent burning or excessive hardness. Even if they appear slightly undercooked, they will continue cooking as they cool.
11. Gently put a biscoff cookie on each cookie. You can use a bit of melted white chocolate (or cookie butter) first to help it stick. Or, if you're feeling fancy, slice a big marshmallow in half and place it on top. Let it get a bit melty, then add the biscoff cookie.
12. Allow the cookies to cool for 10 minutes before serving.

### Pro Tips

- I’ve found that HEB’s unsalted butter is the best for this recipe, - I highly recommend this brand (wish this was sponsored).
- The butter has to brown (almost burn) until you see that it's not bubbling anymore. The burntness of the butter is essential for this recipe.
- Another thing about the butter is that you can't let it chill in the fridge (even if you want to speed up the process), trust me, I tried it and my cookies turned out so dry because the butter solidified and we don't want that. The butter has to be liquid but cool when you add it to the recipe. 
- Refrigerate the dough as much as you can, overnight or 24 hours before it works better. This is because we use espresso for this recipe, and the more time we let it rest, the better the flavor of the dough.
- You can buy an espresso shot from your local coffee shop, or make it on a moka (I like to use Café Bustelo’s espresso ground coffee when I use this). But, if you don’t have time to make it or you don’t want to use an espresso shot, you can use a mixture of 3 tablespoons of water with 2 tablespoons of instant coffee, and add 2 tablespoons of this to the cookie mixture. It works as good as the espresso shot, and if you add more instant coffee you can make it even stronger than espresso.
- While an ice cream scoop can be used to form cookie balls, an alternative method is to shape the balls by hand into a cone form. This prevents them from completely melting in the oven if the mixture is too liquidy and results in cookies with a more uniform circular shape.
- If you’re adding the marshmallow, I recommend that you put it as soon as it's right out of the oven. If you think the marshmallow is not melting, put it for 1-2 minutes in the oven after putting it on top of the cookie, and then put the biscoff cookie quickly.
- You can break the biscoff cookie in half so that it's easier to press it on top of the cookie.
- Do NOT put the biscoff cookie on the cookie ball before putting it in the oven. When you do that, you’ll burn the biscoff cookie or it will turn super hard after you take them out. 
- I recommend that you add crushed biscoff cookies and sliced almonds in the dough when mixing as well, as it gives an extra crunch. I found that baking the sliced almonds before baking also gives them a fancy touch.
