Hey there! It’s Ofelia and I have yet another delicious recipe for you to try. I don't mention this as often in my posts, but if you’ve read the About section of this blog, you know that I'm in my senior year of mechanical engineering. As a senior, I have a hard time keeping up with my class assignments or just finding energy to do everything that I need to do. So, coffee has been a must for me since I started my major. However, I’ve found that it gives me so much anxiety if I take it too much, so about 2 years ago, I found my obsession: Matcha. It might not work as effectively as coffee in terms of giving you energy, but it does give me a boost when I need it. It was a little hard to like it at first, as it has this sort of fishy taste, but I’ve found that with the right preparation, it can be delicious. Between many matcha desserts, I’ve fallen in love with these Matcha White Chocolate Cookies that one of my best friends Sofia made me try. I mentioned before that I love baking dates, and about a month ago Sofia, Celine and I got together to have a little dinner party. Sofia wanted to try this TikTok matcha cookie recipe that she saw on tiktok, so we decided to make it. The turnout was so good and we all loved making the recipe. You can even add macadamia nuts or almonds into the dough for extra crunchiness. Hope you get to try this!

### Recipe

**Ingredients:**

- 1 ½ cups of all-purpose flour
- 3 tablespoons of ceremonial matcha powder. 
- ½ cup of  unsalted butter (1 stick)
- ¾ cup of brown sugar
- ½ cup of granulated sugar
- 1 egg
- ½ teaspoon of baking soda
- 1 teaspoon of salt
- 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
- ¼ of a cup of biscoff cookie butter (or any cookie butter brand)
- 90 gr of white chocolate
- 10-11 biscoff cookies (optional)


**Instructions:**

1. Place a small saucepan on medium-high heat and melt the butter slightly (you can also do this step in the microwave). Let it cool completely in a heat-resistant container or cup at room temperature.
2. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the brown sugar and white sugar until well incorporated.
3. Once the butter has cooled down, pour it into the mixing bowl with the sugar. Whisk until fully combined.
4. Add the egg, vanilla extract, cookie butter, and espresso shot (approximately 2 tablespoons or slightly less). Mix for about a minute and a half until smooth.
5. Sift the flour, baking soda, matcha powder, and salt into the mixture. Whisk a little before adding it all to the cookie mixture. Fold the mixture using a spatula, making circular motions and pressing firmly to ensure complete incorporation. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl to incorporate all ingredients evenly. Adjust the flour if the dough is too liquidy, ensuring it becomes firm without making it cake-like.
6. Cut the chocolate into medium chunks, and add them to the cookie dough, folding until fully incorporated.
7. Chill the dough for at least an hour.
8. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) for 15 minutes.
9. Form 10-11 balls from the dough, using an ice cream scoop for best results.
10. Grease a baking tray with butter and place the dough balls about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, avoiding overbaking to prevent burning or excessive hardness. Even if they appear slightly undercooked, they will continue cooking as they cool.
11. Optional step: Gently put a biscoff cookie on each cookie. You can use a bit of melted white chocolate (or cookie butter) first to help it stick. Or, if you're feeling fancy, slice a big marshmallow in half and place it on top. Let it get a bit melty, then add the biscoff cookie.
12. Allow the cookies to cool for 10 minutes before serving.

### Pro Tips

- I strongly recommend using a good quality of matcha for this recipe, as the ceremonial matcha has a stronger taste and color. When using other types of matcha, you might end up using more as the flavor and color would not be as noticeable. I like to use Chamberlain Coffee Original Matcha Green Tea Powder, since it works really nice. 
- Since bringing out the green color in the recipe is a little hard, I suggest that you don't overburn the butter in the recipe as it can turn out even darker.
- If you don't really mind the color, you can add 2 tablespoons of an espresso shot to the dough to have an extra taste to this. Just remember that the matcha already has caffeine, so be careful.
- I have mentioned the importance of chilling the dough in previous recipes, but I will repeat it. It's very important for the shape and texture of the cookie. 
- If you’re freezing the dough for cookies at any time later in the week or something, remember to bring them to room temperature before baking them, as sometimes they tend to stay in a thick shape after being in the freezer for so long. 
- Remember to do the cone shape that I mentioned before in different recipes. This helps to have more of a rounder and prevent the dough from completely melting in the oven, especially if you don't chill your dough long enough.
