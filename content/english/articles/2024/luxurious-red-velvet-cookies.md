## Luxurious Red Velvet Cookies

Hello again! It's Ofelia, back with another delicious recipe that I’m thrilled to share with you. After the overwhelming love for my Brown Butter Chocolate Chunk Cookies, I wanted to keep the momentum going with something equally indulgent and captivating.  
This recipe is close to my heart, blending the classic elegance of red velvet cake with the comforting, handheld delight of cookies.

Like many of you, my fascination with red velvet began at a young age, at family gatherings and holiday parties, where a red velvet cake was always the centerpiece. Its unique flavor and vibrant color have made it a favorite of mine, inspiring me to capture its essence in cookie form. Perfect for any occasion, these Red Velvet Cookies are soft, chewy, with a hint of cocoa and a beautiful red hue, finished with white chocolate chips and a sprinkle of sea salt for an irresistible sweet and salty contrast.

### Recipe

**Ingredients:**

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 tbsp red food coloring (or more for desired color)
- 1 tsp white vinegar
- 1 cup white chocolate chips

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
3. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugars until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract, red food coloring, and vinegar.
4. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet, mixing until just combined. Fold in the white chocolate chips.
5. Use a cookie scoop to form balls of dough and place them on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.
6. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are set but the centers are still soft. Do not overbake.
7. Remove from the oven and cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
8. Serve and enjoy the velvety richness of these Red Velvet Cookies.

### Pro Tips

- For the most vibrant red color, use a high-quality liquid food coloring. Gel food coloring can also be used, but you might need to adjust the quantity.
- The secret to the soft, cake-like texture of these cookies lies in not overmixing the dough. Once the dry ingredients meet the wet, mix until just combined.
- If you’re feeling extra decadent, consider drizzling or dipping the cookies in melted white chocolate once they’ve cooled.
- Like our previous recipe, these cookies benefit from resting the dough in the fridge for at least an hour, which helps in developing the flavors and achieving the perfect texture.

As we journey together through the world of baking, I hope these Red Velvet Cookies bring a touch of luxury and a lot of smiles to your kitchen. Stay tuned for more recipes, and remember, the best part of baking is sharing the love and the treats. Happy baking!
